Q1.Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Data structures and algorithms are crucial in managing large inventories because they enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of vast amounts of data. 
Without them, operations like searching, updating, or deleting items would become time-consuming and resource-intensive. 
Optimized algorithms ensure that the system remains fast and scalable, even as the inventory grows, helping businesses make real-time decisions and maintain accurate stock records.

Q2.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
In this program, an ArrayList is used to manage the list of products, making it suitable for dynamic storage where the number of products can change at runtime. 
The ArrayList provides indexed access, allowing easy addition, deletion, update, and traversal of items, as seen in the methods like add_product, delete_item, and update_item. 
While it's efficient for small to moderately sized inventories, for faster lookups by product ID or name in larger datasets, structures like HashMap could be introduced. 
Overall, the ArrayList offers simplicity and flexibility, making it a practical choice for basic inventory management systems.
