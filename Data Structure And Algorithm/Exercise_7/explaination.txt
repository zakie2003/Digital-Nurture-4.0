Q1. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem, usually based on a specific condition known as the base case, which stops the recursion.
It can simplify various problem where we need to check all kind of possible solution by breaking them into smaller, similar subproblems.For Example,iterating over a tree or just finding
factorial of a number.
